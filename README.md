 ## Description

  This app allows a user who is a parent at a school to search a database of parent contact info based on a child's name or class affiliation.

  https://github.com/jessealdana/super-dir

 ## User Story

  As a user who wants to connect with other parents at my child's school, I enter a child's name into the search box for a narrow search of parents whose child bears that name or I enter a class name to get a list of all the parents of children in a given class.
